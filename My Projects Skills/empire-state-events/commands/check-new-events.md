# /check-new-events

Lightweight orchestration on top of Workflow A. Detects new event invites (parsing a PIPELINE block when the GCal description has one, the raw organizer description otherwise), dedups against Notion, then runs the full research + content chain on each — interactively, one event at a time. Alex controls the pace via a continue-or-quit prompt between events.

**Input:** none — pulls automatically from the "Going to Events" calendar.

**Output:**
- For each event processed: full Notion writes (Companies, Topics, People, Events, Content Drafts) + HubSpot writes + LinkedIn drafts in `needs_review` via pre-event-content
- Final summary: events seen / processed / skipped / errored

---

## Trigger

This command runs when:
- Alex types `/check-new-events`
- Alex says "check the calendar for new events", "any new events to research", "what's new on my calendar", "pull new invites"

## Required inputs

None. The calendar ID and time window are hardcoded; the PIPELINE block is the structured input when present; the raw organizer description is the fallback.

## Step 1 — Query Google Calendar

Use `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__list_events` with these exact parameters:

- `calendarId`: `4c84184ac3e761c3f94be43193656a785ece4752ed6b553facfcb52e668a333b@group.calendar.google.com` (the "Going to Events" calendar)
- `startTime`: current ISO 8601 timestamp in `America/New_York`
- `endTime`: 14 days from now in `America/New_York`
- `pageSize`: 50
- `eventTypeFilter`: `["default"]` (skip OOO, focusTime, birthdays, etc.)
- `orderBy`: `startTime`

**Failure mode:** if the MCP call errors, report it cleanly and exit. Do NOT proceed with stale or partial data.

## Step 2 — Detect PIPELINE blocks

For each event in the response, check the `description` field for a PIPELINE block.

A valid PIPELINE block is:
- A line containing `---` (markdown horizontal rule, may have surrounding whitespace)
- Immediately followed by a line starting with `PIPELINE` (case-sensitive)
- Continues to end of description (no terminator needed)

The description may contain:
- HTML entities (`&amp;`, `&lt;`) — preserve as-is for now; LLM parser will handle
- `<br>` tags — treat as line breaks for block detection
- Other organizer content — only the PIPELINE block matters for parsing

**Raw-description fallback (the common case, observed 2026-07-07; YED-193).** Most invites carry the organizer's
raw Luma/meetup description and NO PIPELINE block. Do NOT exit on "no PIPELINE block found": parse speakers,
hosts, companies and topics directly from the raw `description` (it is usually rich enough), flag the deviation
once, present a detection summary + scope confirm (which events; steering; whether to include HubSpot), then
proceed. HubSpot writes are the lowest-value step on a multi-event batch; offer them as a follow-up rather than
forcing them inline. Exit only when there are no new (non-deduped) events at all.

## Step 3 — Parse event fields (LLM, not regex)

For each event, extract the structured fields using natural-language understanding (NOT strict regex). **Source:** the PIPELINE block when present; otherwise the raw organizer `description` (the Step 2 fallback, and the common case). With a raw description, pull speakers, host, topics and URL from wherever they appear in the organizer copy, and mark the event `source: raw-description` so the Step 5 summary shows which events were parsed without a PIPELINE block.

- **Speakers** — list of `Name (Title, Company)` entries, but tolerate format variations: comma/dash/at-sign/semicolon separators, bulleted lists, missing titles, missing companies, just-names
- **Host** — organizing entity name (free text)
- **Topics** — comma-separated keywords (any separator OK)
- **URL** — first http(s) URL in the block or description (optional)
- **Intent** — one of `attend`, `documentary`, `both` (optional; default to `attend` if absent)

Required fields: Speakers, Host, Topics — except for `source: raw-description`, where only Host + Topics are required (mixers and leaderless collectives list no speakers; pass `Speaker: none listed` to `/event-deep-research`, which accepts speaker-less invites). If a required field is missing or empty, log the event as a parse warning and exclude it from processing — surface it at the end of the run.

**Also capture the Google Calendar event ID** from the GCal MCP response's `id` field (NOT the iCalUID — use the `id` field). This is the stable join key for downstream content (and matches `calendar_event_id` on the disabled Granola API path, should it return). Pass it through to `/event-deep-research` as a field named `Google Calendar Event ID` so it lands on the Notion Event row.

## Step 4 — Dedup check against Notion

For each parsed event, query the Notion Events DB to check whether a row already exists:

- Use `mcp__notion__notion-search` with the event title as query, then filter results to the Events database (`9dcbc999-b4ed-4a51-b48a-10aaf171f1ba`)
- Compare by event title + start date (both must match)
- If a match exists: classify as DUPE (skip — do not re-process)

**Invite changed after research ran (ruled 2026-09-18):** if the Notion Event already exists but the invite's speaker list or venue differs from the stored row → re-run `/event-deep-research` in REFRESH-light for the changed entities only; a time-only change updates the date silently; anything else is a no-op. (Closes the 2026-05-20 open design decision in `execution-week-frictions.md`.)

**Failure mode:** if Notion search fails, fail open — proceed to Step 5 and let `/event-deep-research`'s own Step 1.5 dedup logic catch the duplicate (slightly more work, but no data risk).

## Step 5 — Present detection summary to Alex

Before running any research, surface the full plan in this format:

```
📅 Checked "Going to Events" — next 14 days

Found N events (PIPELINE block or raw-description parse):
  ✨ NEW (will process):
    1. [Event title] — [date, time]
       Speakers: [parsed]
       Host: [parsed]
       Topics: [parsed]
       Intent: [parsed]
       Source: [PIPELINE / raw-description]
    2. ...
  ⏭️  DUPE (already in Notion — skipping):
    - [Event title] — [date]
  ⚠️  PARSE WARNING (required field not found — needs your attention):
    - [Event title] — missing: [field]

About to run /event-deep-research + pre-event-content on N new events, one at a time.
Continue? [y / cancel]
```

Wait for Alex's confirmation before proceeding.

## Step 6 — Per-event chain (loop with continue-or-quit)

For each NEW event, in chronological order (soonest first):

### 6a.0 Steering interview (run FIRST, before research)

Run the `steering-interview` skill for this event **before** `/event-deep-research`. It is a short, skippable, 4-question intake (content / structure-format / additional research / anything-else) that captures Alex's event-specific context up front — so it steers the research and content instead of being corrected afterward via Notion comments.

- Run it in the main conversation (it is an interactive interview, never a subagent).
- **Answer #3 (additional research) must be passed into the `/event-deep-research` input** (Step 6a) so it scopes the fan-out — this is why the interview runs before research, not after the brief.
- Carry answers #1 (content), #2 (structure/format), and #4 (anything else) to the `pre-event-content` invocation (Step 6b).
- The skill persists the answers as an `## Author Steer — [date]` block on the Event page and they later feed `update-voice-and-style`.
- If Alex says "skip" / "nothing for this one", proceed with zero friction.

This Step-6a.0 interview is **Touch 1 (Aim)** — the pre-research intake that points the fan-out. The
collaborative **Touch 2 (Sharpen)** — genuine forks derived from the committed brief — runs **inside
`pre-event-content` (its Step 1.9)** during Step 6b, after `/event-deep-research` produces the brief.
No separate Sharpen step is needed here; it's covered downstream by the flow this command invokes.

See `.claude/skills/steering-interview/SKILL.md` for the two-touch protocol, routing table, and persistence.

### 6a. Run /event-deep-research

Execute the full `/event-deep-research` workflow as documented in `.claude/commands/event-deep-research.md`. Pass the Step 3 parsed fields as the input in this natural-language format:

```
Event: [event title]
Date: [event date]
Location: [event location from GCal]
Google Calendar Event ID: [event.id from GCal MCP response]

[Original description from organizer — text BEFORE the PIPELINE block, or the whole description when there is none]

Speaker: [Speakers parsed in Step 3]
Host: [Host parsed in Step 3]
Topics: [Topics parsed in Step 3]
URL: [URL parsed in Step 3]
```

The Google Calendar Event ID line is the deterministic join key for downstream `/post-event-content` runs against Granola. `/event-deep-research` writes it (inline, Step 4) to the Events DB `Google Calendar Event ID` text property.

This is the format `/event-deep-research` already accepts (per its required-inputs spec: "natural-language description with cues like 'Speaker: Jane Smith, CTO at Acme; Topics: agentic systems, enterprise AI'").

Follow **all** steps of `/event-deep-research` exactly — Steps 1 through 6 **and Step 4.5 (Render + append the Deep Read)**, which sits between Steps 4 and 5. Step 4.5 is easy to skip precisely because it is not an integer step, but it is **mandatory**: it renders the Deep Read body (the ~40-min field-guide commute read) beneath the Scan head. A run that commits the Scan head but leaves the Event page's `## Deep Read` at `<!-- deep_read_rendered: pending -->` is **incomplete, not done** — the brief will look thin. Track any such event and surface it in the Step 7 summary (see the "Deep Read PENDING" block below). Include the three human-in-the-loop checkpoints (entity confirm, triage approval, brief approval); do NOT bypass any approval gate.

**Registry precondition (Step 4.5).** `field-guide-renderer` is session-frozen — if this session predates its registration, the render loop cannot dispatch and *every* event will strand at `pending`. If you cannot dispatch `field-guide-renderer`, say so up front and either run the whole batch in a fresh conversation, or process the events and list every Deep Read as PENDING in the summary — never report an event as fully complete with an unrendered Deep Read.

When Step 1 (entity confirm) runs, the entities will largely already be in the input — confirm should be a fast y/n.

### 6b. Run pre-event-content

After `/event-deep-research` completes (Notion + HubSpot writes done), invoke the `pre-event-content` skill for the same event. It pulls the research brief from Notion automatically.

Output: LinkedIn post drafts + speaker/host DMs in Notion Content Drafts (`needs_review` status).

### 6c. Continue-or-quit prompt

After both 6a and 6b complete for one event, present:

```
✅ [Event title] complete.
   - Research brief (Scan head): [Notion URL]
   - Deep Read: rendered ✅   |   ⚠️ PENDING — re-run Step 4.5
   - Content drafts: N items in needs_review

[X] more events pending: [list]

Continue with next event ([next event title])? [y / quit]
```

If Alex says yes / y / continue: move to next event.
If Alex says no / quit / stop / done: exit and run Step 7.

## Step 7 — Final summary

When the loop exits (either all events processed or Alex quit), report:

```
📊 /check-new-events session summary

Processed: N events
  - [Event 1 title]: brief + N drafts
  - [Event 2 title]: brief + N drafts
  ...

Skipped (already in Notion): M events
  - [list]

Parse warnings (needs your attention):
  - [Event title] — missing [field]
  - Action: add the missing field (or a PIPELINE block) to the invite and re-run /check-new-events

Pending (not processed this session): K events
  - [list]
  - Action: re-run /check-new-events later to continue

⚠️ Deep Read PENDING (Scan head shipped, body NOT rendered): J events
  - [Event title] — Event page marker still `deep_read_rendered: pending`
  - Action: re-run Step 4.5 of /event-deep-research (idempotent) in a session where field-guide-renderer is registered
  - This is the #1 silent-degradation to check: a "thin brief" IS an unrendered Deep Read. If J > 0, the batch is not fully done.
```

## Step 8 — Deep Read gate (batch close — YED-139, mandatory)

The Step 7 "Deep Read PENDING" block above is a *report*; this step is the *gate* that catches a silent skip. Run it after the summary, before declaring the batch done:

1. **Enumerate every Event page touched this batch** — from this batch's own record of processed events.
2. **Re-fetch the real marker for each** — `notion-fetch` the Event page and read its `<!-- deep_read_rendered: [date|pending] -->`. Notion is the truth.
3. **Verdict:**
   - **All `rendered` (or explicitly waived)** → batch passes; report Deep Read ✅ for all.
   - **Any `pending`** → the batch is **NOT complete**. Interactive: **block close** — list the pending event(s) and do not report the batch as done until each is re-rendered (idempotent Step 4.5) or explicitly waived with a reason. Autonomous/batch: report the batch **FAILED** with the pending list.
4. This step is the only Deep Read gate — do not skip it.

**Registry-frozen batch (the Aug-2026 failure path):** if `field-guide-renderer` was unregistered this session, *every* event stranded at `pending`. That is a FAILED batch — either re-run the whole thing in a fresh session, or record each page as waived (with the reason) in the summary and re-render later. Never report the batch "complete" with pending events.

---

## Failure modes

- **GCal MCP error** — report cleanly and exit. Don't fake data.
- **No events found in time window** — report "No upcoming events on 'Going to Events' calendar in next 14 days" and exit.
- **No PIPELINE blocks** — not a failure: parse from the raw description (Step 2 fallback, Step 3).
- **All events are dupes** — report "Found N events but all are already in Notion" and exit.
- **Parse warning on an event** — exclude from this run, surface at end with the missing field, don't fail the whole session.
- **`/event-deep-research` fails mid-event** — report which event failed, mark it as "errored" in the summary, and prompt whether to continue with the next event or quit.
- **Deep Read didn't render (Step 4.5)** — the Scan head is fine, but the Event page shows `deep_read_rendered: pending`. NON-fatal per event (doesn't block the batch mid-run), but it MUST appear in the Step 7 "Deep Read PENDING" block AND is caught by the **Step 8 gate** (YED-139): any `pending` marker means the run is not complete. Never report an event as fully "complete" with an unrendered Deep Read (that is exactly how the whole Aug-2026 batch shipped thin). Re-run Step 4.5 (idempotent) in a session where `field-guide-renderer` is registered, or waive it explicitly with a reason.
- **Notion search fails (Step 4)** — fail open: proceed without pre-dedup, let `/event-deep-research` Step 1.5 dedup catch it.

## Why this design (not a scheduled remote routine)

`CronCreate` (the only scheduling primitive available in this environment) is session-bound — jobs fire only while the Claude Code REPL is running on Alex's Mac. A scheduled remote routine on Anthropic's infrastructure also wouldn't work because project-level slash commands (`/event-deep-research`) and skills (`pre-event-content`) are scoped to Claude Code running in this repo, not to Claude.ai routines.

Additionally, `/event-deep-research` has three human-in-the-loop approval gates by design (entity confirm, triage approval, brief approval) — quality controls that catch hallucinated entities, prevent duplicate writes, and let Alex correct the brief before commit. "Silent automation" of the full chain would either bypass those gates (losing quality) or require Alex's presence anyway (so the scheduling buys nothing).

The session-driven design captures the original "PIPELINE block in the invite = structured intake" insight without those constraints. Alex types `/check-new-events` when he opens Claude Code; drafts populate as he watches; review distributes across days because Alex picks one event at a time via the continue-or-quit prompt.
