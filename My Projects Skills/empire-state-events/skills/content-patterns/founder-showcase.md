# Founder Showcase Pattern — The Startup-Showcase Recap

A reusable content shape for post-event coverage of **founder / startup showcase**
events — curated evenings where a handful of early-stage founders each pitch on
stage, primarily to recruit. First codified from **The Shortlist — August Founder
Showcase** (2026-08-24). This file is the authoritative definition; the
`content-correspondent` skill and `/post-event-content` command read it when the
event is a showcase.

Owner: Alex — personal voice. Edit when the showcase style evolves.

Triggers (any of): the event is a "founder showcase," "startup showcase,"
"demo-ish pitch night for hiring," or a curated series where multiple founders
present back-to-back and call candidates to apply. Named-series examples: **The
Shortlist**.

## The premise (why this format exists, and why it's good content)

These are **early-stage startups doing genuinely interesting things** that come to
a showcase to **promote themselves and increase exposure in the community**,
because **hiring is ramping up**. Several arrive **extra timely** — a fresh
funding round, a new product, a marquee customer — which is exactly what makes
them newsworthy *right now*. The audience is job-seekers; the QR-code opt-in is
the hiring funnel.

For Alex, that means the showcase is a **high-density scouting + documentarian
surface**: 6 companies, each self-summarizing across the same dimensions, each
naming who they are and who they're hiring. The content job is to be the
**useful curator** — the person who turned six back-to-back pitches into one
clean, tag-able, referenceable field guide the whole room (and everyone who
couldn't get in) will want. Decenter the self: the companies are the subject,
Alex is the curator, not the protagonist (see `content-style-guide.md`).

---

## The presentation formula (discerned — what each founder covers)

Showcase organizers coach founders to a formula. At The Shortlist, every founder
was explicitly "tasked with talking about **four founder stories**" on top of a
standard company rundown. The observed beats, in order:

1. **Who we are** — name, founder's role, one-line "what we do."
2. **The problem / why we built it** — the pain and the founding insight.
3. **What we've built + what makes us unique** — product, the differentiated bet,
   traction proof (customers, scale, growth).
4. **Recent milestones / funding** — the round, investors, marquee logos, growth
   numbers. *(This is where the timeliness lives — and where the confidentiality
   flag lives; see Sensitivities.)*
5. **Who we're hiring** — the open roles **and the profile** of the person they
   want ("hungry for a challenge," "forward-deployed," etc.).
6. **Why work for us** — culture, values, the candidate pitch.
7. **~4 founder stories** — humanizing anecdotes: origin story, a pivot decision,
   a guerrilla-marketing stunt, a team retreat, a culture moment. This is the
   texture that separates a showcase recap from a funding-news roundup.
8. **Team-in-the-room callouts** — the founder points to co-workers present
   ("Sam's in the back") who are there to recruit or support. **Capture these —
   they become CRM contacts** (see Contact Extraction).

**Discerning the formula per event:** read the transcript for the repeated
skeleton. If founders were given N stories, name N. If the organizer stated a
thesis (e.g., The Shortlist's "hiring is broken on both sides, so we do curated
IRL"), lead the post with it — it frames the whole evening.

## Showcase focus (the key variable — establish this early)

Every showcase has a **focus** — the reason these companies came to promote themselves
right now. The focus is the single most important input: it steers the post's angle AND
determines what the **first-comment reference links** point to. **Establish the focus
before drafting.** Two ways:

1. **Infer it from the room** — what are the founders overwhelmingly there to do?
2. **Alex clarifies the purpose** — he'll often say "this one was all about new product
   launches" or "this was a hiring push." His steer wins; ask if it's ambiguous.

Common focuses (extensible — a new focus just implies a new link target):

| Focus | What the room is doing | First-comment reference links point to |
|---|---|---|
| **Hiring / promotional** | Recruiting; every founder names open roles | Each company's **careers / jobs page** (verified live URL) |
| **Product launch** | Companies unveiling new products/features | Each company's **launch post / feature page / blog** |
| **Funding** | Rounds just closed; momentum story | Each company's **funding announcement** (public only — see Sensitivities) |
| **Mixed / general** | No single dominant thread | The most relevant link per company (careers if hiring, launch if shipping) |

A showcase can be **primarily one focus with secondary threads** (e.g., hiring-focused but
two companies also just shipped). Lead with the primary; the first comment can carry the
primary link per company and note a strong secondary where it exists.

## The 6-dimension company breakdown (the core deliverable)

For **each** company, break the pitch down across these six dimensions. This is
the internal brief's per-company block AND the source for that company's carousel
slide. Keep each dimension to 1–3 tight lines.

| # | Dimension | What to capture |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Who they are** | Company name, founder(s) + role, one-line what-they-do, HQ, stage. |
| 2 | **The problem they solve** | The pain + the founding insight, in plain language. |
| 3 | **What makes them unique** | The differentiated bet / wedge / "why them." |
| 4 | **Company culture** | Values, work model (in-person/hybrid/remote), the vibe the founder sold. |
| 5 | **Recent / funding events** | Latest round + investors + marquee customers + growth. **Public only** — see Sensitivities. |
| 6 | **Hiring needs** | Open roles + the candidate profile they described. |

**Accuracy discipline (mandatory):** showcase transcripts are usually raw
auto-transcripts that **garble company and founder names and numbers**. Before any
name, number, or thesis claim goes into public content or the CRM, **verify it via
web search** (fan out one `company-researcher` per company). This doubles as the
source-check rule (`CLAUDE.md` §6). Never tag a person by a transcript-garbled
name.

---

## Sensitivities (read before publishing anything)

- **"Stays in the room" / confidential funding.** Founders often disclose a
  just-closed round on stage and explicitly say it's **not public** ("this stays
  in the room"). That number must **NOT** appear in any public post, carousel, or
  CRM note. Keep it in the internal brief only, clearly flagged, and in the public
  content use only what is **already publicly reported** (verified). When in doubt,
  cut the number and describe the momentum qualitatively.
- **Name verification before tagging.** Per `feedback_name_people_and_thank_speakers`:
  name people wherever possible, but if a full name is unresolved, name what you
  have and flag before tagging — never publish a guessed surname.
- **Thesis/positioning claims.** Any firm- or person-level belief/positioning
  claim needs a primary source before public use (rule 12).
- **Thank the founders + the organizer/host.** Name and thank every founder who
  presented and the series + host venue.

## The LinkedIn post shape

**Editorial principle — bring the startups to life (added 2026-08-25, Alex directive).**
The founders stood in front of a room of strangers and shared their backstories, their
raison d'être, their impact, their worldview, what makes them interesting. A bullet-point
roll-call throws all of that away. **The least we can do is match their effort with ours.**
So the post is **prose, not a data table**: each company still gets its **elevator pitch +
funding fact**, but then comes to life — the founding story, the conviction behind it, the
human detail they offered (the cabin-in-the-woods bet, the closet tatami mat, "we're all in
on the nepotism problem," the deck built between a crying baby and a tired wife). The
**carousel carries the scannable bullets**, which is exactly what frees the post to tell the
story. Mine the transcript for these moments — they are the point, not garnish. **Dig deep.**

A showcase recap post. Structure:

- **Opener (never "I"-led).** Lead with the thesis of the night, a headline stat
  (curiosity-hook + number), the host/series, or the ecosystem angle — per
  `feedback_no_i_led_openers`. Good showcase openers: the organizer's thesis
  ("Hiring is broken on both sides — so [Series] does it in a room, old-school"),
  or the density stat ("Six NYC founders, ~$Xm raised between them, all hiring —
  here's the room in one scroll").
- **The frame** — one or two lines on what the showcase is and why this format is
  worth paying attention to (curated, IRL, recruiting-first).
- **Every company, one tight entry** — a scannable list, one entry per company: name +
  one-liner + the single most timely/interesting hook (tuned to the focus) + the
  focus tag ("hiring [roles]" / "just launched [X]"). **HARD RULE: every company that
  presented is named and referenced in the post — nobody gets dropped for length.** The
  carousel carries the depth; the post carries the roll-call.
- **The curator's read** — a short, *earned* synthesis: the pattern across the companies
  (e.g., "five of six are building agents that operate, not just generate"). Stance
  is earned by the space a recap gives it (`feedback_upcoming_week_stance_and_self`).
- **Close + service** — thank the founders + series/host by name; point readers to the
  companies and to the **first comment** for the links. No "follow for more."
- **2 option variants (A/B)** per the ship-all-variants rule — one thesis-led,
  one density/stat-led opener.

### The first comment — focus-driven reference links (REQUIRED)

The post body stays clean; **all reference links go in the first comment** (per the
style guide's link rule). The showcase **focus** decides what each link points to — **one
link per company, all companies present**:

- **Hiring focus** → each company's **careers / jobs page**.
- **Product-launch focus** → each company's **launch post / feature page / blog**.
- **Funding focus** → each company's **public funding announcement**.
- **Mixed** → the most relevant link per company, labeled.

Rules for the first comment:
1. **Verify every URL is live** — do NOT guess `/careers` or a blog path; confirm it
   resolves (fan out a quick `company-researcher` if needed). A dead link in the first
   comment is worse than none.
2. **Every company appears**, in the same order as the post. If a link genuinely can't be
   found for one company, say so in that line (e.g., "Thunder — role via [Built In listing]")
   rather than silently dropping it.
3. Format: `Company — one-word-what-they-do — <URL>`. Keep it a clean, swipeable list.
4. A secondary link is fine where a company strongly fits a second focus (e.g., a hiring
   showcase where one company also just shipped).

## The carousel — one slide per company (Arc 4 variant)

Uses **Arc 4 (One Question / N Perspectives)** from `visual-briefs.md`, specialized
as a **company-spotlight grid**:

- **Slide 1 — Cover.** The night in one line: series + host + date + the density
  stat ("6 founders · all hiring · $Xm+ raised"). Bold typography card.
- **Slides 2…7 — one company each.** Identical **company-spotlight card** frame,
  content varies. Each card carries a consistent mini-layout drawn from the
  6-dimension breakdown:
  - Company name + founder + role (header)
  - One-line what-they-do
  - **Problem** (1 line) · **Unique** (1 line)
  - **Recent/funding** (public only) · **Hiring:** [roles]
  - small footer: stage · HQ
- **Final slide (optional) — the pattern.** The curator's one-line synthesis across
  the six + "all are hiring — intros via [series]." Typography card.

**Frame parallelism is the whole point:** slides 2…7 must be visually identical
templates so the reader compares companies at a glance (same header position, same
field order, same accent logic). Accent = amber (business/GTM/hiring) per the
palette, since the whole artifact is a hiring showcase; optionally tint each
company card's accent by its category, but keep layout identical.

**Build + export:** author as one self-contained HTML file (one `.slide` per
company at 1080×1350), render to a 4:5 PDF via headless Chrome per `visual-briefs.md`
→ `## Execution` (Chrome at the non-standard `/Applications/Tech Stack/` path).
No Gamma/Canva.

**Adds-information check:** the carousel is NOT a re-print of the post list — it's
the structured 6-dimension breakdown the post text only summarizes. That structure
is the added value.

## Contact extraction → CRM + Apollo (showcase-specific)

Showcases are a contact goldmine: every founder is a hiring decision-maker, and
each founder **names co-workers in the room** who are there to recruit or support.

**Extract two tiers:**
1. **Founders** (primary) — full name (verified), title, company, LinkedIn if
   found. High-value, reliable.
2. **Called-out co-workers** — the people founders point to ("Sam's in the back,"
   "Grant and Luz can show you the product"). Capture name (often first-name-only
   from the transcript), company, and the role/context the founder gave.

**Deliverables:**
- **Apollo enrichment CSV** — one row per contact with the columns Apollo's bulk
  match/enrich expects: `first_name, last_name, full_name, company, title,
  linkedin_url, email, notes`. First-name-only co-workers: fill what's known, leave
  last_name/email blank, and note "needs last name — first-name-only from event."
  Apollo matches best on full name + company domain or LinkedIn URL; flag weak rows.
  **Alex uploads the file himself** (do not spend Apollo credits programmatically —
  Tier-3 per `CLAUDE.md`).
- **HubSpot contacts** — founders + resolvable co-workers, associated to their
  company, with a Note capturing event + role + hiring context. Present a
  **confirmation table** before the live write (HubSpot MCP convention), and dedup
  by name+company first.

## Notion output (pipeline canonical)

Write to Content Drafts per the standard post-event flow: the LinkedIn post
(both variants) + the embedded `## Visual Brief` carousel block, Event Phase =
`post_event`, related to the Event row (create it if missing), People (founders),
and Companies (the six). The internal 6-dimension brief is the `post_event_brief`
analog — store it as the browsable source of truth.
