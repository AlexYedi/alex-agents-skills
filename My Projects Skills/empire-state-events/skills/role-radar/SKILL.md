# Role Radar Skill

You are Alex's **role-sensing + tracking engine**. LinkedIn's Jobs API is closed to new partners and scraping the account is ruled out, so we aggregate roles from legitimate sources (the ATS boards APIs, plus Apollo at named targets when asked), score them against Alex's **Target-Role ICP**, and track application status in Notion.

**The target — source of truth is `.claude/references/me-model.md` §1.5 "Target-Role ICP" (read it; keep this rubric in sync):** quota-carrying **commercial** roles at top-tier **AI-native** companies. **The in-scope shapes are defined ONCE, in Step 3 — go read them there; they are deliberately not restated here** (a second copy drifts, which is what happened on 2026-09-24) (`.claude/references/target-companies.md`). Deep GTM + systems + AI-building is the **differentiator, not the job title**. **Score by the role's MECHANISM (what the JD says it does), not its title.** The decisive filter is **leverage vs. "in spite of the company"**: keep roles that give leverage (existing book/expansion, BDR/marketing/inbound support, or a **PLG** product-led motion); reject owning the entire funnel alone.

This is a **signal scanner** feeding the Empire State pipeline (its siblings `trend-radar` and `voice-radar` were pruned 2026-09-28).

**Why this exists (concept primer for Alex):** a job tracker is just a small CRM with a scoring function on the front. The value isn't the list — it's (1) **one inbox** for roles that today scatter across Dice/LinkedIn/company pages, (2) a **consistent ICP score** so you spend application energy on A-tier fits, not whatever surfaced last, and (3) **status tracking** so nothing falls through. The scoring rubric (Step 3) is the opinionated part and is self-contained here.

**Ground rules (Empire State conventions):**
- **Ethics:** Public ATS APIs and official endpoints only. No LinkedIn scraping.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Present scored roles for review before any Notion write.
- **Credit discipline:** Apollo and Clay are credit-metered. Confirm spend explicitly (exact wording below).
- **Notion plan constraint (re-verified 2026-09-27):** `notion-query-data-sources` SQL **does** work on this plan but is **quota-capped** — the shared workspace limit tripped after ~12 queries in one session. Spend it on ONE bulk pass per run (Content Hash + Tier + Status + Notes for every row — a few LIMIT/OFFSET pages of the same query, ~100 rows each), then use `notion-fetch` per page for anything else. Never design a step that needs SQL more than once; when the cap hits mid-run, fall back to `notion-fetch` — it has no such cap.
- **No fabricated numbers / honest gaps:** if a source errors, say so.

**Scope:** ATS boards APIs (primary) + Apollo-at-targets (credit-gated, optional); Notion-only; manual trigger. **Dice and RSS.app were REMOVED 2026-09-27 (Alex):** never used in any scan to date — the Dice connector was never authenticated and no RSS.app feed was ever generated — and the 31-board ATS registry covers the target list directly. Do not re-add them without a coverage case. The **graph-producer** (roles → MI graph) is **live as Step 5.5** (YED-149, 2026-09-27 — shipped once the Roles DB proved its dedup: 203 rows, 0 duplicate ATS keys). Scheduled ingestion stays deferred.

---

## Inputs
- **(Optional) Role focus** — defaults to Alex's target archetypes (below). May narrow, e.g. "just GTM engineer + RevOps".
- **(Optional) Location** — default **New York City** + **Remote (US)**.
- **(Optional) Recency** — default last 7 days on the ATS `posted` date (Ashby/Lever/Workable); Greenhouse rows have no posted date and are treated as UNKNOWN freshness.

---

## Step 0 — One-time setup (first run only)
1. **Roles DB:** the Notion **Roles** database EXISTS (created 2026-09-08) — data source `collection://3a174257-e90b-48be-b4bb-097ba5dc4231`, under the NYC AI Event Content Hub. `notion-fetch` it to confirm the live schema before writes (schema also in Step 4). If it were ever missing, recreate via `notion-create-database` with the Step 4 schema (HITL).

---

## Step 1 — Pull from sources (parallel)

Primary = the **ATS boards JSON APIs** (public, first-party — the endpoints companies' own careers
widgets call; legitimate, full-fidelity, not scraping). Read the company→ATS registry in
`.claude/references/target-companies.md` ({ATS vendor, board token/slug} per company).

### 1a. ATS boards APIs — `curl` + `jq` (Bash), PRIMARY
Read the **company→ATS registry** in `.claude/references/target-companies.md` (**31 companies** — 21 confirmed 2026-09-08, **9 added 2026-09-21**, **1 added 2026-09-24** from the Flywheel "New York AI Mafia" graphic; the per-board live-verification dates are recorded in that registry file, not asserted here). Per company, curl its board and **`jq`-project to the compact shape BEFORE anything enters context** — raw boards are 0.5–12 MB, never dump them:

- **Greenhouse** (board tokens per company: see `target-companies.md`):
  `curl -s "https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{token}/jobs?content=true"`
  → `jq '.jobs[] | {id, title, url:.absolute_url, loc:(.location.name // ""), updated:.updated_at}'`
  ⚠️ **Greenhouse exposes no posted date — `updated_at` is last-modified, and projecting it as `posted` is a real defect (fixed 2026-09-20).** A role open for months that got any edit this week reads as new. So: (a) project it as **`updated`**, never `posted`; (b) **never write it to the Roles DB `Posted Date`** — leave that property empty for Greenhouse rows; (c) **never use it alone to decide the recency window.** On 2026-09-19 this surfaced Vercel Enterprise AE and Anthropic CSM Tech as "this week" when both were long-open. For Greenhouse rows treat recency as **UNKNOWN** and confirm on the posting page before claiming a role is new. **Ashby `publishedAt`, Lever `createdAt` and Workable `published_on` are true posted dates** and may be used normally.
- **Ashby** (board slugs per company: see `target-companies.md`):
  `curl -s "https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/{board}"`
  → `jq '.jobs[] | select(.isListed) | {id, title, url:.jobUrl, loc:(.location // ""), posted:.publishedAt, remote:.isRemote}'`
- **Lever** (fallback only): `curl -s "https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{co}?mode=json"`
  → `jq '.[] | {id, title:.text, url:.hostedUrl, loc:(.categories.location // ""), posted:((.createdAt/1000)|todate|.[:10])}'` (Lever's `createdAt` is epoch **milliseconds** — convert before it reaches `Posted Date`; caught by the Gemini seat 2026-09-27)
- **Workable** (accounts per company: see `target-companies.md`) — added 2026-09-21 so Workable-hosted registry companies stop being invisible to every scan:
  `curl -s "https://apply.workable.com/api/v1/widget/accounts/{account}?details=true"`
  → `jq '.jobs[] | {id:.shortcode, title, url:.shortlink, loc:((.city // "") + " " + (.country // "")), posted:.published_on, remote:.telecommuting}'`
  **Freshness is TRUE here** — `published_on` is a real posted date (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`), so it may be written to `Posted Date` normally, unlike Greenhouse. Natural key = `workable:{shortcode}`. Note the job object nests nothing useful under `.id`; **`shortcode` is the stable id**.

- **Filter to commercial titles BEFORE scoring** — keep title matches for Customer Success / CSM / Account Manager / Account Director / Account Executive / **Engagement Manager** / **Sales Director / Sales Lead / Sales Leader / Enterprise Sales Director / VP Sales / Head of Sales** / **`Growth Strategist|Growth Account|Growth AE|Scaled Growth` (never bare `Growth` — see the drop-list bullet)** / **Named Account / Client Director / Client Partner / Relationship Manager**; drop eng/product/design/recruiting/finance/marketing-IC (`grep -iE` on the projected title). **The keep-list is intentionally INCLUSIVE of leadership-signal titles (Sales Director, Head of Sales, Manager-of-function): they pass the title filter on purpose so IC / player-coach roles that happen to carry those titles aren't silently dropped — the v2.2 IC-vs-people-management gate in Step 3 then reads the JD and demotes the pure-leadership ones to C.** (This closes two real misses: "Enterprise Sales Director" @ Sierra and "Engagement Manager" @ Snorkel, both dropped by the old narrower list.) The description (`.content` / `.descriptionPlain`) is what Step 3 scores by *mechanism* — fetch it only for title-passing rows.
- **The drop-list runs AFTER the keep-list and WINS (fixed 2026-09-20).** A title that matched a keep term is still dropped when it also matches
  `Engineer|Developer|Designer|Scientist|Researcher|Recruiter|Accountant|Controller|Counsel|Marketing Manager|Product Manager|Program Manager|Content|Brand|Demand Gen|Technical Account Manager`
  **`Technical Account Manager` added 2026-09-27 (Alex: "technical account manager is out")** — it passed the keep-list on "Account Manager" and no drop term caught it; the build-quality judge (Sonnet seat) found it still named as an ideal IC title in the v2.2 examples after the 09-24 purge. A TAM is a technical seat, not a book (Vercel's Sr TAM JD: "will not carry a sales quota").
  **There is no protected set. The drop-list simply wins.**
  ⚠️ **A PROTECTED carve-out for `Solutions Engineer|Sales Engineer|Solutions Consultant` used to live here and was REMOVED 2026-09-24 (Alex).** Ruling, verbatim: *"solutions engineer is way outside my skill set or proposed focus … make sure we are not going technical with any roles."* The carve-out existed to stop the bare `Engineer` drop term from killing Solutions Engineer — but that title is no longer wanted, so the bare `Engineer` drop is now **correct behaviour, not a regression.** Do not re-add the carve-out without a new ruling.
  **The bare word `Growth` was the original leak** — on 2026-09-19 it passed "Growth Marketing Manager", "Senior Product Designer (Growth)" and "Senior Backend Engineer (Growth)", all dropped by hand. The keep-list above is now narrowed at source to `Growth Strategist|Growth Account|Growth AE|Scaled Growth`, so the leak is closed where the grep is built, not only here. (The leadership-signal titles — Sales Director, Head of Sales — match no drop term and are unaffected.)
- **Natural key = `{ats_vendor}:{id}`** (Step 2 dedup; for Workable the id is `.shortcode`); freshness = `posted` for **Ashby, Lever and Workable**. For **Greenhouse, freshness is UNKNOWN** — `updated` is not a posted date (see the caveat above).
- **Fan out 5–6 companies per distillation subagent** (curl works in subagents; the subagent declares `tools: Bash, Read` and returns a **projected** TSV (title, id, url, location, posted, comp band) so raw JSON never touches parent context — scoring happens in Step 3, after Step 2 has removed already-tracked rows, so no subagent scores a role the DB already holds).
- **Coverage = the 31 registry companies. Deferred (skip v1; recorded on YED-149):** registry companies with no big-4 API by slug (named in `target-companies.md`); the Workable-hosted one left this list 2026-09-21, now supported above. The Step 4 digest MUST report gaps loudly: "N companies returned 0 rows / M unmapped" (registry-staleness guard).
- 4 fixed API hosts — no per-company `settings.local.json` allowlist churn. **Endpoints + field shapes verified live 2026-09-08; the 9 additions + the Workable shape re-verified live 2026-09-21; General Intuition verified live 2026-09-24.**

### 1b. Apollo job-postings at named targets (credit-gated — optional)
- Only if Alex wants roles at specific targets *not* on the big-4 ATS. **Off by default** — the scan runs the boards; Apollo is a per-request add-on. Resolve the org ID via Apollo org search, then call `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_io__apollo_organizations_job_postings`.
- **MANDATORY confirmation — say this EXACT message before the call:** `"This will consume 1 credit. Do you want to proceed?"` If pulling N companies, confirm the TOTAL: "This will consume N credits. Do you want to proceed?" Do not proactively show the balance. Do not call without explicit approval. Apollo may be blocked on the free plan → report and skip.


---

## Step 2 — Dedupe
- **Natural key** for ATS-API roles = **`{ats_vendor}:{ats_job_id}`** (stable across re-runs). For Apollo roles with no ATS id, fall back to `content_hash` = lowercased, whitespace-collapsed `title + "|" + company`.
- Collapse the same role appearing across sources into one record (keep all source links + the natural key).
- Dedupe against the Roles DB: one bulk SQL read of `Content Hash` (see the plan constraint above), or `notion-search` scoped to the Roles data source by the natural key / `title company`; `notion-fetch` to confirm.
- **Fallback dedup on `title|company` (added 2026-09-27, YED-224).** Rows written before ATS keying carry `Content Hash = title|company`, and a natural-key check alone cannot see them. After the natural-key pass, compare each candidate's normalized `title|company` (lower-case, whitespace-collapsed, company alias-tolerant) against the DB. A hit means the legacy row IS this posting → **re-key that row** (write the ATS key into `Content Hash`, plus `Source`, `URL`, `Posted Date`) instead of creating a second row. Why: the 09-19 scan wrote ~20 title-hash rows; the 09-24 scan duplicated five of them by ATS key, and the 09-27 scan would have re-added Runway's Strategic Enterprise AE as "new". Re-posts (same title+company, old id gone, new id live — Writer did this to four roles on 09-22) are handled the same way: re-key, don't duplicate. **Freshness = the ATS `posted_at` for Ashby, Lever and Workable; UNKNOWN for Greenhouse** (Step 1 caveat — `updated_at` is last-modified, not a posted date). Skip roles already tracked unless status/materially changed.

---

## Step 3 — Score against the Target-Role ICP rubric (`icp_score`, 0–100) — self-contained

Mirrors `me-model.md` §1.5 (keep in sync). **Score by the role's *mechanism* (JD language), not its title.**

> **THE FIVE SHAPES — nothing else is in scope (ruled by Alex 2026-09-24).**
> **(1) Account Manager · (2) Account Director · (3) quota-carrying Customer Success Manager ·
> (4) "all channel" Account Executive — existing book AND outbound · (5) Growth Strategist —
> *only when it carries a book* (see the Growth book test below).**
>
> **(5) GROWTH STRATEGIST — IN, but the title only raises the question (ruled 2026-09-24).** Alex:
> *"growth strategist should be kept, but it is tough to keep up with all of the fun names that
> companies come up with — so yes, but no when it refers only to a marketing function, which many
> companies do."* So run the **same book test** rubric v2.2 uses for IC-vs-management:
> **does the role own accounts, a book, expansion or a quota?** Yes → score it as shape 5.
> No — it runs campaigns, demand-gen, lifecycle, funnel metrics or content → **it is a marketing
> function and is OUT: score it `0 + REJECT` on role mechanism**, however good the company. (Stated
> explicitly because every other failure path in Step 3 names its bucket — judge round 2.) This is the *same leak* the narrowed keep-list
> already guards (bare `Growth` passed "Growth Marketing Manager" on 2026-09-19); the grep narrows
> the candidates, the book test decides them.
>
> **No technical roles.** Solutions Engineer, Sales Engineer, Solutions Consultant **and (ruled 2026-09-27) Technical Account Manager** are **OUT** — the first three
> were removed from the keep-list, the drop-list carve-out and the scoring table on 2026-09-24. A
> pre-sales/technical-win seat is not a book.
>
> Shape 4 is the one that needs care: **"all channel" means existing + outbound, not outbound-only.**
> An AE who prospects and closes with no existing-business component is still the own-the-whole-funnel
> reject, however good the comp. *(Worked example, 2026-09-24: Modal AE-Enterprise KEPT — "drive new
> business by generating pipeline" AND "expand existing accounts"; Traversal Enterprise AE REJECTED —
> "own the full sales cycle, from strategic prospecting to closing" with only Sales-Engineering support
> and no book, despite an OTE above the floor and an in-person NYC seat.)*

| Dimension | Points | How to score |
|---|---|---|
| **Role mechanism** (what the JD actually has you do) | 0–35 | *Segment note (v2.3): wherever this row says "Enterprise/Strategic", a **Mid-Market** seat at a top-tier / high-growth AI-native company (AI-native tier 25 or 20) scores the **same points**. MM at any other company is not covered by v2.3: score it on the JD's mechanism and write the call in `Notes`.* · Quota/consumption-carrying Enterprise/Strategic **CSM**, **Account Manager/Director on a book** (retention+expansion vs. a target), or **Growth Strategist** *(shape 5 — apply the Growth book test above; a marketing-function "Growth Strategist" is OUT, not 35)* = **35** · **"all channel" Enterprise/Strategic AE (shape 4)** — new logo *with* explicit inbound + BDR + product pull **AND a named existing-book / expansion component** = **28**. **The existing-book component is REQUIRED, not optional** (tightened 2026-09-24; the old wording read "often + existing book", which let an outbound-only seat score 28). **Support without a book is NOT shape 4** — it scores **0 on this row** (the heavy-new-logo bucket). **To be precise about what that does and does not mean** (the earlier wording said "rescued only by the PLG exemption", which was ambiguous — judge round 2): a support-named/no-book role is **NOT auto-rejected**, because the auto-reject below requires *no existing-business component **AND** no support named*. It simply scores 0 on mechanism, which caps it out of A on arithmetic alone. At a **PLG-primary** company the PLG exemption (v2.1 #2) then floors it into **B/C**; everywhere else it keeps the 0 and lands where the remaining dimensions put it · heavy-new-logo with only *some* support = **0** · full-cycle own-the-whole-funnel solo = **0 + REJECT** |
| **AI-native company tier** | 0–25 | frontier / AI-native (Anthropic, OpenAI, Clay, Vercel, Notion, Sierra, Perplexity, Cursor/Anysphere, …) = **25** · AI-forward high-growth (Ramp, Intercom, Verkada, Rippling, Zip, Glean, …) = **20** · AI-heavy SaaS = **12** · **traditional / non-AI = 0**. See `target-companies.md`. |
| **Leverage / support signal** (decisive — near-veto) | 0–20 | explicit BDR/marketing/inbound support, **existing book / expansion ownership**, **or PLG / product-led-growth as the primary motion** (product generates inbound demand) = **20** · partial = **10** · none / pure top-down-outbound / "own the whole funnel" = **0 + REJECT flag** |
| **AI-multiplier differentiator fit** | 0–10 | JD explicitly values building-with-AI / GTM-systems / technical fluency (SDLC, AI/ML) / consumption-model expertise ("you build with AI daily," "use AI creatively") = up to **10** |
| **Location / culture** | 0–10 | NYC or hybrid (in-person expectation) = **10** · remote-listed but the company has an **NYC office** (in-office optional) = **5** · **fully remote / no office / no in-person culture = 0** (a culture signal, not just a seat) |

**Auto-reject (flag, do not rank):** owns every stage incl. prospecting/demand-gen with **no existing-business component and no support named**; pure-quota hunter IC with no systems/AI surface; **below the OTE floor** (v2.3; the number lives in `me-model.md` §1.5); traditional/non-AI company — regardless of title. **Only the first two rejects (owns-the-whole-funnel, pure-quota hunter) can be lifted by the v2.1 exemptions below** (explicit existing-business component, or PLG-primary motion). **The OTE floor and the traditional/non-AI-company reject are hard gates: no exemption or intangible lifts them** (fixed 2026-09-19, YED-202: the old wording read as lifting all four).

**Tiers (v2.4, 2026-09-11):** **A = ≥85** (apply now) · **B = 60–84** (review) · **C = 40–59** (watch) · **drop < 40**.

> **Why 85, not 78 (raised 2026-09-11 — Alex).** The registry is pre-filtered to AI-native companies (tier 20–25) and most run PLG (leverage 20), so a supported/book-owning role reaches **75–80 on mechanism + tier + leverage alone**, *before* location — and location (max 10) cannot sink an 82. At ≥78, ~half of everything scanned landed in A, which destroyed A's usefulness as a triage signal. **85 restores discrimination** without distorting the mechanism scoring. Roles scoring 78–84 are still strong — they are B (review), not rejects.

### Rubric v2.1 — exemptions & intangibles (added 2026-09-08 — Alex)

Three refinements sit on top of the table above. **Every override-by-exemption call MUST be written and reasoned in the role's `Notes` — a silent bump is not allowed** (keeps the score honest + auditable).

1. **Hybrid new+existing is NOT a hunter.** If a JD *explicitly* names an existing-business / book / largest-account / retention / expansion component **alongside** new logo, the existing book counts as leverage: score leverage **≥10 (floor)**, up to **20** when the existing-book weight is substantial — and the own-the-whole-funnel REJECT does **not** fire. Only a role that owns *every* stage with **no** existing-business component and **no** named support is a pure-hunter reject.
2. **PLG exemption (primary-motion PLG → never drop an all-new-business role).** When the company's **primary GTM motion is PLG** (the product generates inbound demand), an all-new-business seat is **not** auto-rejected — the seller isn't owning the funnel alone; the product is. Floor it into **B/C tier** and set its position inside B/C by the intangibles read below.
3. **Intangibles lever.** For PLG-new-business and hybrid roles, weigh company **intangibles — growth trajectory/stage, founder & exec pedigree, funding, competitive position/market, role-specific upside**. Intangibles (a) *slide* position within B/C, and (b) when **exceptional** (e.g. top-decile growth + world-class founder/backing) grant a **TOP-OPTION EXEMPTION** promoting an otherwise-B role to **A**, and may **override the location hard-negative**. Analyze and state the intangibles explicitly.

*Worked example (2026-09-08):* Sierra **Enterprise Sales Director** (US-Remote) = structural **75 (B)** — hybrid new+existing, leverage 15, loc 0. Promoted to **A by intangibles exemption**: one of the fastest-growing companies globally + founder pedigree (Bret Taylor, OpenAI board chair / ex-co-CEO Salesforce; Clay Bavor, ex-Google Labs) + category-defining agents + funding. Rationale written to the role's Notes.

### Rubric v2.2 — IC vs. people-management axis (added 2026-09-08 — Alex; the title-disambiguation rule)

**Alex is targeting individual-contributor (IC) roles** that directly own a book / accounts / quota / relationships. **People-management / team-leadership roles are OUT for this search** — he wants back to direct impact and to grow *into* leadership via promotion, not enter at that level. Score the IC-vs-leadership axis **from the JD's responsibilities, never from the title string** — the title only raises the question.

**The single test: does the role carry a personal book / quota / accounts?** Yes → in (IC or player-coach). No, it's purely running a team → out.

- **IC = ideal (mechanism scored normally), title notwithstanding:** Account Manager, Customer Success Manager, Engagement Manager, Account Director, an IC Sales Director. *(Technical Account Manager was listed here until 2026-09-27; it is a technical seat and is OUT — see the drop-list.)* Here "Manager/Director" modifies the *accounts/book* owned.
- **Player-coach / team-lead / senior-IC "Lead" = ALSO desirable (keep as IC):** a role that **retains a personal book/quota** while also guiding others ("Account Executive Lead", "Account Manager Lead") is the exact direct-impact-and-grow path Alex wants. Guiding others is fine; the disqualifier is *pure* people-management with **no** book.
- **Pure people-management = drop to C or REJECT (regardless of other dimensions):** the role's primary job is managing a *team* with **no personal book/quota** — hire / coach / develop reps, own the team's number, carry direct reports as the job. Applies even when company + mechanism otherwise score high.
- **Syntactic tell (raises the question only — the JD's book test answers it):** **"[Function] Manager/Director"** (function as adjective — "Customer Success Manager", "Account Director") = usually IC; **"Manager, [Function]" / "Head of [Function]" / "Director of [Function]" / "VP …" / "Sales Manager"** = usually pure people-management → but confirm against the personal-book test, since a "Manager, X" can occasionally be a player-coach with a book (keep) and a "Lead" can occasionally be pure team-lead (still fine per above).

The JD responsibility pattern is the arbiter. When book-ownership can't be determined from available text, **flag it for review rather than scoring it high.**

### Rubric v2.3 — comp floor & level flexibility (added 2026-09-09 — Alex)

- **Comp gate = the OTE floor in `me-model.md` §1.5** (auto-reject below; the numbers and bands live only there, since comp targets stay private). Within range, use the me-model's **ideal / strong / fully-acceptable bands, and do NOT penalize the fully-acceptable band.** Comp is a floor + a tiebreaker, never a linear "higher = better"; weigh it against company growth/opportunity (a floor-level seat at a top-tier rocketship can beat an ideal-band seat at a laggard). When comp isn't posted, **don't infer a reject** — treat as unknown and score on mechanism.
- **Posted RANGE vs. the floor — RULED 2026-09-27 (Alex, YED-210): test the MIDPOINT.** A posting that publishes a range clears the comp gate when `(low + high) / 2 ≥ floor`; a midpoint below the floor is the auto-reject, exactly as a single number below it would be. **Exactly at the floor CLEARS it** (the test is ≥, not >). **One exception — the emerging-seller signal:** when the JD pitches the seat at an early-career / emerging seller (ex-SDR/BDR, "ideal next step into full-cycle ownership", "first closing role"), the realistic offer is the bottom of the band, so test the **LOW end** against the floor instead of the midpoint and write the exception in `Notes`. No other point in the range is ever used (top-of-range was rejected as too easy to stretch; bottom-of-range as rejecting strong seats over a wide band). **When two rules apply at once** (e.g. a base-only band on an emerging-seller JD), use the **higher** resulting figure and write both figures in `Notes` — ruled by Alex 2026-09-27 ("rubric takes higher number"); the comp gate exists to stop wasted cycles, not to reject a seat on the most pessimistic reading of an ambiguous posting. **One-sided range ("up to $X", "as much as $X", no low end published) — ruled 2026-09-27 (Alex): score it as `X − $20K` and test THAT against the floor;** write the assumed figure in `Notes` so the row shows it was derived, not posted. A posting with no number at all is still "comp not posted" (above): score on mechanism, never infer a reject. **Salary-only / base-only range — ruled 2026-09-27 (Alex): test the TOP of the range.** When the posting labels the band as salary or base ("base salary range … before variable compensation", "annual salary", or an Ashby band that separately says "Offers Commission"), the number is not OTE and the midpoint understates the seat, so test the **high end** against the floor; write the label and the number used in `Notes`. An explicit OTE band keeps the midpoint. An **unlabelled** band is treated as OTE (midpoint) — the stricter read; say so in `Notes` so a recruiter answer can flip it. Where a structured ATS field and the JD body disagree, the JD body is the posting. *Applied on ruling day to that morning's drops: four rows came back (three of them clearing exactly at the floor), the rest stayed dropped; arithmetic is in each row's `Notes`.* The floor number itself still lives only in `me-model.md` §1.5. *Applied on ruling day to the three rows that had been held since 09-19/09-24 — one cleared to A, two dropped; the arithmetic is in each row's `Notes` and on YED-210, not here.* A range is therefore **no longer a Held case**; the Held bucket remains for the next genuinely undefined state.
- **Level flexibility — Mid-Market is IN at top-tier companies** *(wired into the Role-mechanism row of the scoring table via its segment note; change both together).* Score **MM roles at high-growth / top-tier / more-technical AI-native companies as full fits on MECHANISM** (book / expansion / consumption ownership); do **NOT** down-rank for segment size vs. Enterprise/Strategic. This encodes Alex's deliberate **step-back-to-step-forward** strategy (land MM at a top-tier company, prove value, work back to Enterprise). Enterprise/Strategic stays ideal; MM at the right company is squarely in.

## Step 4 — Present scored roles + create/confirm Roles DB (HITL gate)

If the Roles DB doesn't exist, present this proposed schema and create it via `notion-create-database` only after Alex approves (mirrors the existing DB pattern):

**Roles DB schema**
- `Role Title` (title)
- `Company` (text)
- `Source` (select: greenhouse / lever / ashby / **workable** / apollo / manual — `rssapp_li` and `dice` remain in the live Notion select for historical rows only and are never written since the 2026-09-27 removal) — **`workable` was added to the live Notion select 2026-09-24**; it was missing since Workable support shipped on 09-21, so a Hugging Face row had no valid `Source` value to write. Caught by the build-quality judge, round 2.
- `Location` (text) · `Workplace` (select: remote / hybrid / onsite)
- `URL` (url) · `Company URL` (url)
- `ICP Score` (number) · `ICP Tier` (select: A / B / C / drop)
- `Status` (select: new / reviewing / applied / interviewing / rejected / offer / archived)
- `Posted Date` (date — the ATS `posted_at`, for freshness; **leave EMPTY for Greenhouse rows** — `updated_at` is last-modified and writing it here launders a wrong date into the DB) · `Date Found` (date)
- `Content Hash` (text — the dedup natural key `{ats_vendor}:{ats_job_id}`, or `title|company` fallback) · `Notes` (text)
- (later) relations to Companies / People

Then present the ranked roles:

```
## Role Radar — {date}, {location}, last {recency}

### A-tier ({n})
- **{Role}** @ {Company} — ICP {score} — {workplace}, {location}
  why: {1-line — archetype + AI-nativeness + tier + signals}
  {detailsPageUrl} | {companyPageUrl}
### B-tier ... ### C-tier (collapsed counts) ... ### Dropped ({n}, reasons)

### Held — needs your ruling ({n})
- **{Role}** @ {Company} — **no tier** — {the undefined case — one the rubric has no rule for} — {what it would score on mechanism alone} — **Linear: {YED-nnn, filed this turn}**
```
**Freshness marker per row:** a Greenhouse row has **no posted date** (Step 1 caveat), so never let the `last {recency}` header imply one. Mark Greenhouse rows `freshness: UNKNOWN`; **Ashby, Lever and Workable** rows may show a posted date.

**The Held bucket is mandatory when it is non-empty** — it is the only place a role in an undefined rubric state reaches Alex. A held role is never silently ranked and never silently dropped. The posted-range-vs-floor case was ruled 2026-09-27 (v2.3 midpoint rule, YED-210) and is no longer a Held case; the bucket exists for the next undefined state, and every new one gets a Linear issue the same turn.

End with: **"Add which roles to the Roles DB? (A-tier / all / numbers / none)"**. STOP for approval.

---

## Step 5 — Write approved roles to Notion
- For each approved role: dedupe-confirm (Step 2), then `notion-create-pages` into the Roles DB with `Status = new`, the computed `ICP Score`/`Tier`, `Content Hash`, `Date Found = today`, both URLs.
- **`Source`: write the ATS vendor that produced the row** — the same token used in the `Content Hash` natural key (`{ats_vendor}:{id}`), so the two can never disagree. One of the eight select options above.
- **`Posted Date`: write it for Ashby, Lever and Workable rows. Leave it EMPTY for every Greenhouse row** — `updated_at` is last-modified, and writing it here launders a wrong date into the DB (Step 1 caveat, restated here because this is the line that actually performs the write).
- **A HELD role (Step 4's Held bucket) is written with `ICP Tier` left BLANK** — the `A / B / C / drop` select intentionally gets no value — plus an `ICP Score` if mechanism alone yields one, and a `Notes` line naming the undefined case and the Linear issue that owes the ruling. Blank tier is the durable signal that the row is unresolved; never coerce it into `drop` or into a tier.
- Existing role with material change → `notion-update-page` (don't duplicate).
- Status is Alex's to advance (new → reviewing → applied → …); the skill only sets `new` on intake.

## Step 5.5 — Mirror the written roles into the MI graph (YED-149)

Every Roles row written or re-keyed in Step 5 becomes one `role_posted` event in the graph, plus a `company —subject→`
edge. Spec + the reasoning behind every rule: `docs/archive/notes/yed-149-spec-2026-09-27.md`. Runs inline in this thread
(REST through `spine_client`; never the Supabase MCP). Additive, never a gate: if `SUPABASE_API_KEY` is unset, print
`graph write skipped: SUPABASE_API_KEY not set` in Step 6 and stop here.

1. **Pull the rows just written, SQL shape.** `notion-query-data-sources` on the Roles data source, selecting
   `url, "Role Title", "Company", "Content Hash", "ICP Tier", "ICP Score", "date:Posted Date:start", "Source",
   "userDefined:URL", "Status", "Location", "Workplace"` and filtering to this run's pages. **Never select `Notes`**:
   Alex's free text stays in Notion.
2. **Write them to a scratch file** as `{"roles": [<rows verbatim>]}` (in the session scratchpad, never the repo).
3. **Dry-run, then live:**
   `.venv/bin/python .claude/scripts/substrate.py ensure-roles --manifest <file> --aliases-from .claude/references/target-companies.md --dry-run`,
   then the same without `--dry-run`. `--aliases-from` maps board slugs and registry names (`acmelabs`, `acme`) to
   the name the graph already uses (`Acme`, `Acme (Parent)`). Read the dry run's `would create N companies:`
   line first. A listed company that already exists in the graph under another name (e.g. `Acme` vs `Acme Labs`)
   is a duplicate in the making: add `"company_aliases": {"acme": "Acme Labs"}` to the manifest (or fix the
   registry name), re-run the dry run, and only then write. A `REFUSED <ats key>` line means the same posting sits
   on two Notion pages; resolve that in Notion.
4. **Rules the verb enforces (don't re-implement them):** the Roles page id is the only idempotency key (a rescan
   creates 0; a missing page id is refused); ICP Tier `drop` is skipped and counted; Greenhouse rows get no
   `event_date`; `confidence = 1.0`; topics are never minted from this path.
5. Step 6 summary line: `Graph: N role events (created X · matched Y · skipped drop Z)`.

What the graph does with them: `/event-deep-research`'s Context Pack **never lists roles in the ledger**. A seed
company gets one count line instead ("Acme — N tracked roles (A:x B:y)"), and applications/interviews appear
nowhere (migration 0011 + `retrieve.py`).

---

## Step 6 — Close out
- Summary: roles added by tier, sources used, any source gaps, credits spent (if Apollo used).
- **Rows in the DB that are NOT on the boards (added 2026-09-27, YED-224):** count and name every non-archived row whose `Content Hash` was not seen this run. Before calling one closed, check it against the **raw, unfiltered** board — the title filter drops out-of-scope titles (Solutions Consultant/Engineer since the 09-24 ruling), and those read as "gone" when they are merely out of scope. Closed → propose `Status = archived` with a dated note; re-posted under a new id → re-key the existing row (Step 2). Present this as its own block in the close-out; it is HITL like every other write.
- Offer next: "Pull contacts/hiring managers at the A-tier companies?" → Clay enrich (credit-gated). Tie A-tier targets back to the Notion Companies DB where they already exist.

---

## Failure modes
- **An ATS board errors, times out or rate-limits** (curl non-200, empty `jobs[]`, JSON parse failure) — retry once with a longer `--max-time`; if it still fails, list the company under the Step 4 "N companies returned 0 rows" gap line by name. Never treat a failed board as "no roles".
- **Apollo org not found / API blocked** — Apollo may be blocked on the free plan; if the call fails, report honestly and run on the ATS boards alone. Never fabricate roles.
- **Roles DB schema drift** — `notion-fetch` the data source; live schema wins.

## Confidence & honest gaps
- **Strong (high):** aggregation + consistent ICP scoring + status tracking across the 31 ATS boards (+ Apollo when asked).
- **Gap (high confidence):** this does not see the full LinkedIn Jobs index (API closed, no scraping). RSS.app of saved searches was the intended partial bridge and was removed 2026-09-27 unused; TheirStack (paid) is the option if coverage ever becomes the constraint. Name the gap; don't imply full LinkedIn coverage.

- Graph-producer (Step 5.5): `substrate.py ensure-roles` · spec `docs/archive/notes/yed-149-spec-2026-09-27.md` · `.claude/references/market-intel-spine.md`.
- Tools — `curl` + `jq` (ATS boards), `mcp__claude_ai_Apollo_io__apollo_organizations_job_postings` (optional), `notion-search`/`notion-fetch`/`notion-create-database`/`notion-create-pages`/`notion-update-page`.
