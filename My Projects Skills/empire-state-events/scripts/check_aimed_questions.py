"""Mechanical check for a Prior-Context Pack's `## Aimed Questions` section (YED-217).

Turns "every question is traceable to a carried claim" from an eyeball call into a
repeatable one. For each question it checks:
  1. ANCHOR  — the Anchor line quotes the claim, and every quoted fragment (split on
               the "…" elision) appears word-for-word in the raw pull (--raw). The raw
               pull is the source of truth: cards paraphrase, so without --raw it falls
               back to the pack outside the Aimed Questions section. A claim id
               (c:xxxxxxxx) cited on the question must exist in the raw pull.
               Anchors over 25 words WARN (spec: ≤25, elide with …).
  2. TRUST   — a KNOWN/STALE/UNVERIFIED tag is present.
  3. TARGET  — the target is a name from the verbatim invite, or the room / the format.
  4. SHAPE   — a non-KNOWN question must not open with a premise ("Given that…").

Matching compares words, not typography (punctuation, quote style, emphasis are
dropped), so a curly-vs-straight quote never fails a real anchor — but an inserted,
dropped, or changed word does.

Usage:
  check_aimed_questions.py PACK.md --invite INVITE.txt [--raw RAW.md]
  check_aimed_questions.py --selftest    # proves it catches 5 planted defect classes + the silent-zero case
Exit 0 = all pass · 1 = at least one failure · 2 = no Aimed Questions section.
