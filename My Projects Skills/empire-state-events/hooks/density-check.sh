# density-check.sh — deterministic anti-padding signal for the build-quality judge (deep_read artifacts).
# Computes the word-to-cited-fact ratio of a rendered Deep Read (or a single Deep-Read section) and flags
# padding risk. Mechanizes the build-quality@4 density cap (deep_read only) — the number-side of an
# inherently judgment-laden check, mirroring check-refs.sh: this script supplies the ground-truth counts,
# the judge seat decides whether high ratio = padding (generic-explainer filler) vs. legitimate novice
# on-ramp prose (which is uncited BY DESIGN and must NOT be penalised just for being uncited).
#
# The metric: prose_words / citation_count.  "Citations" = consolidated endnote entries (`[n] source — url`
# lines). Novice on-ramp prose is intentionally uncited, so a section with FEW words needs few citations —
# the flag is for LONG prose that is THIN on grounded facts (the padding smell the spike's anti-padding gate
# exists to catch). Reference band from the Daytona spike: ~150–200 words/citation reads as healthy,
# citation-dense prose. Default flag threshold is deliberately loose (300) so legitimate on-ramp never
# false-flags as long as the artifact carries enough real citations overall.
# Spec: .claude/evals/rubrics/build-quality-v6.md (density cap) · docs/archive/proposals/event-field-guide.md (anti-padding).
#
# Usage: density-check.sh --artifact <path> [--max-ratio <N>]
#   stdout: a per-section word table + a summary verdict line
#   stderr: one-line summary
#   exit:   0 always (advisory; the judge enforces the cap)
