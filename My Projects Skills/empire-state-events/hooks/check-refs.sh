# check-refs.sh — deterministic dangling-reference check for the build-quality judge.
# Extracts load-bearing repo-relative file references from a build artifact and reports which do NOT exist.
# Mechanizes the build-quality@4 dangling-reference cap (models under-apply it — bf17). CONSERVATIVE by design:
# only flags clearly path-shaped `.claude/…` (and `~/.claude/…`) tokens, and SKIPS any reference whose surrounding
# non-whitespace run contains a glob (`*`), an angle-bracket `<placeholder>`, an ellipsis (`...`/`…`), a URL
# (`://`), or a template/regex delimiter immediately after the path (`{slug}`, `\d+`, `.(json|md)`) — so a false
# "dangling" never wrongly caps a good artifact. It errs toward under-flagging (safe): if a run is ambiguous it is
# skipped, never guessed.
# Spec: .claude/references/judge.md.
# The extraction rules here were shared verbatim with build_graph.py (ADR-8 D2) until that script was archived
# 2026-09-28 (docs/archive/scripts/build_graph.py); this file is now their only live home.
#
# Usage: check-refs.sh --artifact <path>
#   stdout: one missing referenced path per line (empty = none missing)
#   stderr: a one-line summary ("N referenced path(s) missing of M checked")
#   exit:   0 always (advisory; the caller enforces the cap)

      # a path followed immediately by `(`, or a real path comma-joined to a template. Two
      # genuinely broken references went invisible per fixture.
