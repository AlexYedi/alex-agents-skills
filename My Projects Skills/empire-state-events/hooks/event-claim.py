"""event-claim.py — one session owns an event's external namespace at a time (YED-213).

THE FAILURE THIS PREVENTS (2026-09-20). Four sessions ran concurrently; two independently ran the full pipeline
for "AI Show and Tell New York". One wrote the Event page, 6 People, 2 Companies, 3 Topics and 5 Content Drafts;
the other reached its Notion write step seven minutes later. No duplicates were created only because that
session happened to run a dedup search and notice a timestamp. It still produced two contradictory records
(Microsoft Agent Framework GA status, Foundry Control Plane GA month) and a thank-you to an unconfirmed
presenter. Duplicate effort is the cheap cost; contradictory records that later runs read as fact are not.

**Git isolation does not isolate Notion.** Both sessions had clean trees, correct branches, no shared files.
Every existing safeguard passed.

WHERE THE CLAIM LIVES, and why not where the issue first proposed. YED-213 suggested
`.claude/.state/event-claims/`. That is gitignored AND per-worktree, so a marker there is invisible to every
other session — the exact blindness YED-214 documented behind this same collision. Claims therefore live
MACHINE-GLOBAL at ~/.claude/event-claims/, outside any worktree, visible to every session on this machine.

ALTERNATIVES WEIGHED (acceptance #2):
  * A property on the Notion Event page — survives across machines, but costs an MCP round-trip per check and
    CANNOT cover the window that actually failed: at Step 1 the Event page often does not exist yet. Rejected.
  * A committed marker (as the graph freeze did, until its 2026-09-28 retirement) — the freeze was a deliberate,
    hours-to-days state change worth a commit; a pipeline claim is ephemeral and per-run, so committing one would add push/pull races and noise
    to every event. Rejected.
  * Rely on the existing dedup search — that is what failed: it is advisory, and it only catches a collision
    once the other session has already written. Rejected.
  * Machine-global runtime dir — covers concurrent local sessions (the real failure), no network, no commits.
    CHOSEN. Limitation, stated plainly: it does not coordinate across machines.

Usage:
  event-claim.py claim   <event-slug> [--ttl-hours N] [--force "<why>"]   # exit 0 claimed · 3 held by another
  event-claim.py check   <event-slug>                                     # exit 0 free/mine · 3 held
  event-claim.py release <event-slug>                                     # always exit 0 (idempotent)
  event-claim.py list [--all]                                             # live claims (or all, incl. stale)
Stale claims expire after --ttl-hours (default 4) so a crashed session cannot lock an event forever.
